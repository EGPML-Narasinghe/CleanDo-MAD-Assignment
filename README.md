# CleanDo-MAD-Assignment
CleanDo an mobile App created for the Mad Assingment by E.G.P.M.L. Narasingle - KD/HDCSE/51/10

Note* - Firebase doesn't allow us to store the "google-services.json" in a public repository due security concerns. So, if the App needed to be tested the User would have to generate an "google-services.json" file.

Step - 

1. Download the API file
2. Under Project section in the Android Studio project pane
3. Paste it in the "App" folder which is present.

Thank You. Create with ❤️ by E.G.P.M.L. Narasinghe (KD/HDCSE/51/10).
